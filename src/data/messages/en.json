    "text": "In distant lands, voices are born alone,\nEach with its own rhythm, a distinct tone,\nWords take shape like grains of sand,\nIn the vast desert of a soulâ€™s command.\nFrom cold mountains to tropical heat,\nLanguages emerge like rivers fleet,\nSo diverse in their melodies,\nBut deep down, they carry the same poesies.\nA sigh of love, a cry of pain,\nResonate the same, no matter the terrain,\nFor what we speak, though singular,\nIs an echo of what is human, universal.\nSounds from mouths that never met,\nIdeas and dreams that in words are set,\nWe evolved apart, it may seem,\nBut built the same bridges, without esteem.\nLanguages differ, yes, it's true,\nBut in their heart lies a brotherhood too,\nFor in every verb, in each expression,\nBeats the same essence: communication.\nThus, though in diverse voices,\nThereâ€™s something that unites, something rejoices:\nThat languages, though distant,\nAre reflections of souls, ever persistent.\nSo we go on, in voices plural,\nBut united by gestures, sounds, and signals,\nFor what we say, anywhere we connect,\nIs the deep-seated desire to interact."
